The Exchange is a web application that facilitates the transfer of tokens issued by a 
Treasury into something of value.

Before you run the application, you will need to copy `exchange.properties.example` 
into your application's classpath and rename it to `exchange.properties`. Update these
properties to reflect your configuration.
